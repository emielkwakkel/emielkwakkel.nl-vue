**Angular, React of Vue? The most frequently asked question in the front-end world, and one that will inspire countless blogs and vlogs. Questions like “Which framework should I learn?” and “Are you an Angular/Vue/React developer?” suggest that as a developer, you need to pick one—or that the choice is made for you based on the project you’re working on. It’s time to change that mindset.**

I’m mostly in the Angular camp—on most projects, I’ve primarily worked with Angular. As a trainer for AngularJS and Angular Fundamentals, I’m happy to share that knowledge. But I don’t see myself as an “Angular Developer.” It’s just a framework. It’s 95% plain TypeScript, a toolkit that helps you focus on building functionality.

Are you an Angular developer? Then you might miss that amazing React opportunity where you could have made a real impact. Are you 100% focused on React? Then that Vue project at ABN might pass you by. And you’ll quickly discover that the framework you’ve chosen is used differently at every client.

To test this, I spent three hours one evening building a Vue 3 version of my Encrypt app. Transitioning from @angular/http to Axios, from Angular Services to Vue Mixins, from @angular/router to vue-router, and from Reactive Forms to v-model input binding. The result can be viewed here. Does it follow all Vue 3 best practices? Not fully yet, but that will come naturally when you work with it full-time on a client project.

With your new mindset, you’ll have confidence in your foundation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and your ability to read documentation. Whether you’re building a chatbot with the Alexa SDK NPM package, a backend with GraphQL, an Ionic hybrid app, or simply an Angular/React/Vue PWA—the client’s needs come first, not the framework.

_We make technology work!_
