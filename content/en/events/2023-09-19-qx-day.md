## About QX Day 2023

The theme of QX Day 2023 is Generative AI—the game-changer of our time. The possibilities of this technology are groundbreaking, and exploring both its potential and the necessary frameworks is a top priority for all organizations. Managing the potential impact of this technology poses a significant challenge.

Of course, Generative AI is not the only item on organizational agendas. Innovations, transformations, improving customer experience, and enhancing or strengthening competitive positions are daily priorities. All of this must be done with sustainable impact—for the organization, our employees, our customers, society, and the planet we must care for so diligently.

Will you leave QX Day 2023: SustAInable Quality Engineering, feeling inspired?
