## About QX Day 2022

This yearâ€™s theme was: Boost.Your.Impact.
Our field of Quality Engineering is becoming increasingly complex, challenging, and exciting in a world of Agile and DevOps teams, intricate ecosystems, ever-evolving technologies, and increasingly diverse tooling! What impact do we make daily from Quality Engineering on users, customers, technologies, and the world? How can we enhance that impact, and what role do Quality Engineering professionals, teams, and organizations play in this?
