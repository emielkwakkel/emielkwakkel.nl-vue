As developers, architects and analysts we all learn how to build quality software. Maintainability, reliability and scalability are all top-of-mind non-functional requirements. By adding sustainability, we can make measurable steps along the way. We will discover how the focus on sustainability will help make choices that benefit the whole organisation.

In this session we are going to cover the basics of Sustainable IT and apply it on frontend architecture. From NX driven monorepositories to microfrontends and all the choices along the way to make your application more sustainable. Becoming more sustainable will both help your organisation and planet.
