## About the event

SNiC is the largest national Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence conference, organized for and by students. This edition's theme of the conference is SustainabilIT, where we focus on what the IT sector can do and has done when it comes to sustainable technology. We focus on the technology of the past, the technology of today and the technology of the future.

## About SNiC

SNiC is an acronym for Stichting Nationaal Informatica Congres (Foundation National Computer Science Conference). This organisation was established in 2004 with the purpose of stimulating interest in knowledge of information and communication technology, and to promote contact between students and the business world. 9 study associations from 7 different cities are affiliated with SNiC. Every year, a conference with an IT-related subject is organised and for each conference, one of those 9 study associations is chosen to take care of the organisation. This year's SNiC was organised on November 27th, 2024 by students from via, the study association for Information Sciences at the University of Amsterdam.
